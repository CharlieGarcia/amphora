## Introduction
Byline is a new way to organize and ship your web creations, guided by two principles:

1. [Organize](##organization) in a maintainable way â€“ to preserve developer sanity.
2. [Compile](##compilation) in a performant way â€“ to make the web a better place.

By separating how we organize our work from how we deliver it, we can let each priority have a clear focus. As web performance best practices change (as they inevitably will), your organizational structure does not.

Finally, by having a clear standard for organizing and compiling our work, we can create [Tooling](##tooling) that makes our goals easier to achieve. Tooling is optional, so use what's useful to you and ignore the rest.
