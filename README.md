## Introduction

Amphora is a partial-API that saves, publishes and composes data from a key-value store.  It is part of the larger Clay project, which is an open-source content management system for publications.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @nymdev/amphora
```

Clay separates concerns into two main areas: components and sites.  Create two new directories in your project:

```
/components  (where your custom components live)
/sites       (for site-level settings, routes, and site-specific assets)
```

### How to create a component

Components in Clay have the following structure:
```
/component-name     unique name of your web component
    template.html   your template, preferably semantic
    schema.yml      describes how the component's data is edited
```

All of these files are optional.

### How to create a template

Clay Components can be made with over 30+ templating languages using [multiplex-templates](https://github.com/nymag/multiplex-templates), such as [jade](https://github.com/jadejs/jade), [mustache](https://github.com/mustache/mustache.github.com),
[handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/),
[nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks),
[react](https://github.com/facebook/react).
Simply end your template file with an identifying extension and Clay will process it in the appropriate engine. For example, `template.jade` will compile from Jade, and `template.html` will simply output unprocessed html.

### How to create a schema

The [Kiln](https://github.com/nymag/kiln) uses a component's schema.yml to determine how a component is edited. For example, if you want to edit the data in this template:

```html
<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>{{ story }}</p>
</article>
```
you could create a schema.yml file that would describe how that data is edited:

```yaml
title:
  _type: text
  _required: true
  _placeholder: Type your title here
story:
  _type: textarea
  _placeholder: Type your life story here
```

The schema.yml file also works without these values; everything is optional. More details about schema.yml are available in the [Kiln](https://github.com/nymag/kiln) project.

## Contribution

Fork the project and submit a PR on a branch that is not named `master`.  We use linting tools and unit tests, which are built constantly using continuous integration.  If you find a bug, it would be appreciated if you could also submit a branch with a failing unit test to show your case.
